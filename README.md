## Overview

The HSV Color Space Analysis Tool is a Python-based script that allows users to perform color space analysis on images using the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color model. This tool utilizes the `multiprocessing` package to maximize CPU performance and significantly speed up the analysis process. It is designed to aid researchers and enthusiasts in conducting academic research or any projects involving color analysis in images.

## Features

- **HSV Color Space Analysis**: Perform color space analysis on input images using the HSV model, which provides better insights into color-related characteristics.

- **Multiprocessing**: Leverage the `multiprocessing` package to distribute the analysis tasks across multiple CPU cores, leading to faster and more efficient processing.

- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can customize various parameters such as image input, analysis settings, and output options to suit their specific research requirements.

- **Visualization**: The tool includes visualization functions to generate graphs, heatmaps, or any other visual representations of the color distribution.

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and comments within the code help users understand the analysis procedures and optimize the tool for their projects.

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system, preferably Python 3.6 or higher.

2. **Installation**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/theDwarfPP/hsv-color-analysis.git
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using `pip`:

   ```
   cd hsv-color-analysis
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Input**: Place the images you want to analyze in the `images` directory inside the project folder.

5. **Customize Settings**: Open the `config.py` file and set the desired parameters for the analysis, such as the number of CPU cores to utilize, analysis threshold, etc.

6. **Run the Analysis**: Execute the main script to start the HSV color space analysis:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

7. **View Results**: The analysis results, including color distribution graphs and heatmaps, will be saved in the `results` directory.
